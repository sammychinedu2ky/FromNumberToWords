# FromNumberToWords
This is javascript function/mini library that converts integers into words. For instance:-
When the function fromNumberToWords is called with an input of  '12388' -- fromNumberToWords(12388) -- it would return "twelve thousand, three hundred and eighty eight"
Feel free to make use of this library for your projects
