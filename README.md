# FromNumberToWords
This is javascript function/mini library that converts integers into words. For instance:-
When the function fromNumberToWords is called with an input of  '12388' -- fromNumberToWords(12388) -- it would return "twelve thousand, three hundred and eighty eight"
Please feel free to make use of this library for your projects.

One cool thing about this library is that it returns the words taking into consideration that the words should be broken down into chunks using comma
